Hello! My name is Rayan. I'm a Computer Science Graduate with passion in various subfields. I'm self-studying Quantum Computing, Machine Learning, and Software Engineering. I also like to nerd about movies and play video-games in my spare time!

I have worked on multiple programming languages and libraries for various types of projects in: 
* Full-Stack Development: Python, FastAPI, React, JavaScript.
* Quantum Computing: Qiskit.
* Artificial Intelligence: Pandas, NumPy, Sci-kit.

I have extensive background in: 
* Calculus
* Linear Algebra
* Algorithms
* Data Structures
* Compilers

I know my GitHub doesn't look that impressive at the moment, but watch this space :)
